SNAKE GAME IN JAVA
==================
A mini-snake game i wrote in java, when trying to learn java. Though this was a horrible experience for me
since I come from the land of C / C++ and JavaScript with a pinch of Python and more javascript.

A fairly feature rich version of the same game is here  http://jsfiddle.net/fyKzV/15/  (which is about 100 line smaller and consice to understand)
I have tried to explain the code myself as much as I can.. but i am fairly new to java.

TO RUN IT...
(Controls are UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT) [[ This is classic game of snake so ... dont expect it to be awesome!]]

>  javac main.java

>  java main
