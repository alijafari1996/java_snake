// GamePanel is a class with extends JPanel in Swing, swing is a library
// or package you can say that allows you to create high performance
// GUI apps with swing's single threaded model
// I have followed the model this file will explain it the best I can.

class GamePanel extends JPanel implements ActionListener{
	// Private members of the GamePanel
	private boolean is_over; // Is game over ?
	public Game game;	 	 // Reference to the game its gonna show
	private Timer t;		 // Internal timer.

	// Public method to paint the game
	public void paint_game(Graphics2D g2){
		if( this.game != null ){
			// Call the function to display the game , if game is not null
			// Since we assign the game externally , it can be null
			this.game.Display(g2);
		}
	}

	// public method to pain Game Over text, after game is over.
	public void paint_game_over(Graphics2D g2){
		g2.drawString("Game Over",Constants.WIDTH/2 - 60,Constants.HEIGHT/2-5);
	}

	// Public method paint,
	// This method is over-ridden method 
	// The JPanel class has a method called paint which is called
	// Automatically with the current graphics context every time the window is to be rendered

	public void paint(Graphics win){
		// Call the super class paint, cleans the canvas and etc
		super.paint(win);
		// Convert Graphics to Graphics2D allows us to draw rectangles and other methods
		Graphics2D g2 =(Graphics2D) win;
		// Call the paint game function
		this.paint_game(g2);
		if( is_over ){
			// If game is over then print game over.
			this.paint_game_over(g2);

		// Synchronise looks with the canvas, otherwise screen will flicker
		// Comment out these two lines and re run the code u will understand what i mean
		Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().sync();
		// Dispose off the events.
     	win.dispose();
	}

	// AN event listener which will listen to our timer
	// and perform game logic. ( Read more about timer in the constructor )
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
		// Calls the tick;
		if( this.game != null && !is_over ){
			this.game.tick();

 	// A private class just to handle keyboards

		this.setFocusable(true);
		// Add a key listener, which will call our keyboard methods
    	this.addKeyListener(new KeyBoardAgent());
    	// Now this following line will create a timer
    	// and call an action <our actionPerformed Method> every
    	// 50 seconds. 50 is the delay parameter
    	// That is why i have implemented actionlistener
    	// The advantage we get by doing so is
    	// We call our actionListener which is the function which performs our
    	// game logic every 0.050 s , which allows us to make the game playable
    	// as well as the game doesnt hangs
    	// The game simply renders in 1ms or even less being so simple
    	// the rest time its free and allows us to listen key events on single thread
    	// supporting the swing architecture
    	Timer timer = new Timer(50, this);
        timer.start();

// The frame handles all the window tasks
// For example close button minimise etc
// while the Panel is used for rendering tasks or basic actions.

	public GameFrame(String title){

		// Add it to game context

		// If the close button is pressed we must exit the program
		this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		this.setBackground(Color.white);
		// Get a reference to the content pane in the Frame(Window)
		Container c = this.getContentPane();
		// Create dimensions
		Dimension Dim = new Dimension(Constants.WIDTH,Constants.HEIGHT);
		// Set preffered sise for both the frame and panel
		c.setPreferredSize(Dim);
